» What are the ARP packets and what are they used for?
ARP packets are used when a computer is sending a packet to an unknown target (don't have his MAC address).
So the computer sends an ARP packet to every computer in the network (broadcast) and waits for a response telling his MAC
(172.16.50.254 is at 00:22:64:19:09:5c)

» What are the MAC and IP addresses of ARP packets and why?
The source sends a broadcast message (everyone is the destination) and then the unknown target sends back the response to the source

» What packets does the ping command generate?
ICMP Packets

» What are the MAC and IP addresses of the ping packets?
The source (172.16.50.1 | 00:21:5a:61:2c:54) sends a packet to the destination (172.16.50.254 | 00:22:64:19:09:5c).
Then a reply message is sent, from the (172.16.50.254 | 00:22:64:19:09:5c) to (172.16.50.1 | 00:21:5a:61:2c:54)

» How to determine if a receiving Ethernet frame is ARP, IP, ICMP?
Using a packet analyzer like Wireshark, we can check the frame protocol (ARP, ICMP, STP, ...)

» How to determine the length of a receiving frame?
In wireshark, we can check the column Length and see the packet size
